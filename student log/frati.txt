I don't have a right measure of code lines and commits. I worked on server's part mainly in the middle part of the project, but it was not added on GitHub until 18/05.

23/04/24: discussions on general architecture of the app
25/04/24: add a functionality to handle user's permissions and sample noise at regular interval. The noise is shown in output in the log
02/05/24: Study on how to handle graph data
06/05/24: Utilization of geocoding's APIs. How to use them to pair noise and streets?
07/05/24: Meeting with prof. Cima
09/05/24: Meeting with my colleagues. Implementation of last checkpoint solution to find which segment has been crossed
10/05/24: Clients now pass data to the server. Working on server side. To receive data and to store them in a JSON file. 
11/05/24: Working on server side. Now the admin can visualize the maps of noise and traffic. Data from JSON file. On client side, the user can click a point and the coordinates are retrieved. It can be useful to compute path
12/05/24: Added on server side the routing part. Created the APIs to pass from the Client to the server the coordinates of start and end point. To find the nearest checkpoint from starting point. A* algorithm to find the best path and to send response to client. Added graphml file exported from gephi. It substitute the JSON one. Created a script to transfer from JSON to Graphml file (NOW DELETED)
14/05/24: Added scripts to update dynamically the weigths of graphml's edges. Added script to remove namespace, the library added them and gephy was not able to read it.
15/05/24: Working with J.Niccolai on map orientation
16/05/24: Still working with J.Niccolai
18/05/24: Fixing server. Count updating was not correct, added a check on amplitude (Not negative and under a threshold to avoid outliers)
Server added to git, until now we worked without GitHub writing code directly with ssh connection to remote host
19/05/24: Review on graph's methrics computed by G.Capecchi's script. Bug fixing and tests. Added a script to generate fake data with G.Capecchi, useful to test if A* avoid noisest streets.
21/05/24: Meeting with all my colleagues to test the app before the meeting with the professors
22/05/24: Meeting with prof. Cima and prof. Vecchio
23/05/24: Start working on documentation with G.Bello. Abstract, introduction and a bit of architecture part. 
24/05/24: Tests on battery consumption with G.Capecchi and G.Bello. Data analisys and creation of this section in the documentation. 
25/05/24: Some changes in documentation, specifically on energy consumption part. Some small changes on Kotlin code, changed max amplitude and some UI improvements. Deleted setCrossingCoordinates API with G.Capecchi
26/05/24: Last checks on code, meeting with my collegues, some work on documentation and presentation. General review
